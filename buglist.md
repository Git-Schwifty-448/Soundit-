# Buglist

* Long text on names of content titles (playlist, community, songs) wraps awkwardly causing spacing issues.
* Occassionally the JS Console pops open on Chrome.
* Sometimes missing data in submissions is not correctly validated. 
* User sessions that are supposed to span multiple browser sessions log the user out.
    * Could be an issue with how the database has been shared during development.
* Email to reset the password does not work on localhost server, theoretically is should work on deployment server.
